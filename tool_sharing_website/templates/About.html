  <p> <br> </p>
  <h3>How it works:<br></h3>  
  <p><br></p>
  <p> Register and create an account to borrow tools. Search the tool you want or the location you would like to borrow from. Find the tool add it to your basket and checkout. Its as simple as that. You can message the lender for more information and view the condition and availability of the tool. <br> </p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>A small deposited will need to be taken just in case anything happens to the tool while its in your possession. But donâ€™t worry, when the tool gets returned safely and in the right condition your money will be returned to you. You can also leave a review so more people can enjoy doing DIY jobs at the fraction of the cost.<br> </p>
